NewSight is an AI-powered Chrome extension designed to encourage users to gather information by reading the news. When launched, the chrome extension generates a summary of the article you are currently on, making it easier to read through mimicking the quick, summarizing capability of social media posts.

However, even the traditional news sources can demonstrate areas of bias. To combat this, NewSight leverages Natural Language Processing technology to provide the user with a snapshot of potential areas of bias. Using the Gemini AI API, NewSight identifies issues that are most likely to impact the impartiality of the author. The extension then displays the the author's attitude toward each of these issues on a scale from 1-100 accompanied by brief explanation. NewSight also provides an general impartiality score as a metric for the article's overall level of bias.
